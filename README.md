- 👋 Hello World, My name is Henrique Rodrigues;
- 👀 I've been working as a Culinary Chef ever since i lived in Canada,
 and still on the food industry for the last 12 years,
 in which six of those years i ran my own bussiness;
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development because I'm looking for a carrer change
 where i can apply all the experience i got from the F&B in a different manner;
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on projects that could change the
 way restaurants and food bussinesses relate with their customers over the web;
